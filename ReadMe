Hello there and Glory to Ukraine!

Here is a simple bash script that creates a directory containing ready to use ovpn cnfigs and necessary files for x100.

Put it in you "put-you-ovpn..." directory of x100

or you may use it as you wish.

PS: In order to make it executable - "chmod +x genvgovpns.sh"
